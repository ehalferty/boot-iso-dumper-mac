First, the disklabel:

00000000  45 52 08 00 00 38 bb d3  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |ER...8..........|
00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|

Then the first partition, which is the partition table as well:

00000800  50 4d 00 00 00 00 00 04  00 00 00 01 00 00 00 0f  |PM..............|
00000810  41 70 70 6c 65 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |Apple...........|
00000820  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
00000830  41 70 70 6c 65 5f 70 61  72 74 69 74 69 6f 6e 5f  |Apple_partition_|
00000840  6d 61 70 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |map.............|
00000850  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0f  00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00  |................|
00000860  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|

That's:
signature = PM
MapEntries = 4
PBlockStart = 1
PBlocks = 0x0000000f
Name = Apple
Type = Apple_partition_map
LBlockStart = 0
LBlocks = 0x0000000f
Flags = 0x00000003 (MAC_PARTITION_VALID|MAC_PARTITION_ALLOCATED)
LBootBlock = 0
(zeroes on out from here)

Then the other partitions:

00001000  50 4d 00 00 00 00 00 04  00 00 00 10 00 00 00 01  |PM..............|
